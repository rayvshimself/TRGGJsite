								<blockquote>The Global Game JamÂ® (GGJ) focuses on bringing communities together through collaboration, innovation and experimentation and our website engages that spirit. No sexism, racism, discrimination or any kind of exclusion will be tolerated in association with the GGJ and we reserve the right to refuse and/or remove content based on our principles. We encourage inclusive and welcoming environments in all our locations. We encourage a free and open activity where creativity should know no censorship and we hope all participants will exercise their creative freedoms. We take pride in our jammers and organizers, but the Global Game Jam Inc. is not liable for anyone's specific views and opinions.</blockquote>

								<h2 id="code">Code of Conduct</h2>
								The GGJ Jamsite Trier (ggjtrier) is a safe space where you can express yourself without fear
								of judgment or harassment. All participants and visitors are expected to treat
								other participants, visitors, staff, and the general public with respect. Under
								the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants be mindful of their speech
								and behaviors both in person and on social media. <br/>
								<br/>
								Ggjtrier is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
								game jam experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
								sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national
								origin, genetic information or religion.
								We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating
								these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the game jam at the discretion
								of the organizers.<br/>
								<br/>
								If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please talk with an organizer or volunteer. If you see
								someone being treated with disrespect, please speak up either yourself or by getting an
								organizer/volunteer involved. With your help we can make sure everyone involved is being
								treated with respect.<br/>
